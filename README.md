# Census-ACS

Code to pull and analyze Census and ACS data based on book [Analyzing US Census Data: Methods, Maps, and Models in R](https://walker-data.com/census-r/index.html)

Utilizing packages [Tigris](https://github.com/walkerke/tigris) and [Tidycensus](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/) for pulling data from the US Census Bureau. Additionally, tidyverse packages will be used for data preparation and wrangling and the sf package for handling spatial objects with ability to export data to other software applications like ArcGIS for cartography. Maps can also be created inside the R ecosystem by using ggplot2 and [tmap](https://r-tmap.github.io/tmap/) for static visualizations and [leaflet](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) for interactive maps.
